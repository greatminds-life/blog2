In any modern countries, especially in United Stated, it is critical to keep your credit score high since it impacts many aspects of life. If you are struggling with low credit score, you would be struggling on the following areas as well, just to name a few:\n Auto loan You may not be able to get auto loan when you buy a car, or you would be charged very high interest rates due to low credit score. House loan Same applies when you buy a house which have much more impact on the amount of money you would need to pay out over the course of time. Rent Your landlord may not allow you to rent a house or business venue. Cell phone or utility You may experience difficulties in getting cell phone service or utility service due to low credit score  Elements impacting credit score Credit score is derived out of the following 5 factors:\n Payment history did you pay your bills on time?\nAmounts owed how much you owe at the moment?\nLength of credit history how long were you using your credit?\nNew credit did you open a new credit card or get a loan?\nCredit mix what types of credit lines are you using?\n Tips to keep high credit score Following tips will help you keep your credit score high or increase fast if it is low now.\n Pay your bill on time As you can see from FICO score graph, payment history takes up the most influence on credit score, 35%. Make every effort to pay your credit bills on time. Keep your credit usage under 30% of your credit limit Second biggest factor is amounts owed, meaning how much credit amounts you\u0026rsquo;re using at the moment. How much remaining balance from your credit card(s), how much you got loans, etc. It is ideal to keep your credit usage under 10% of your credit limit. Monitor your credit score regularly It is a good habit to monitor your credit score regularly in order for you to take any necessary actions if you noticed any decline of your score. You can use free or paid services to get your credit report.

With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.\u0026ldquo;\nsource : https://gohugo.io/\n As Hugo team claimed above, Hugo allows you to build websites quickly and very satisfying way. And in most cases for free without annual or monthly subscription fees. If you are using free hosting services like Github or Netlify, you only need to buy your domain name, usually charged annually. (In my case, I\u0026rsquo;m paying ~$10/year on my domain name)\nQuick start with variety of themes Following list shows open source Hugo themes I personally prefer, for personal blogging, showcasing your portfolio and for business promotion. You can find the complete list of themes here. These themes serve as a great starting place to build great looking websites. You can pick one and tinker it to customize to your needs and preferences(requires some level of understandings of html, css and little bit of javascript, still much quicker to build a website than start from the scratch). I am using Liva theme with some tweaks for this blog site. Click the name of each theme to view the them in action.\nMinimal for personal front page, blog, contact,search, social links  Liva for personal front page, blog, contact, social links  Novela for simple blog, dark/light themes  Mainroad for simple blog - [demo site]  Timer for promotional home, about, service, gallery, blog, contact - [demo site]  Navigator for promotional home, about, service, gallery, blog, contact  Creative portfolio for promotional home, about, service, gallery, blog, contact  Things to learn to build websites with Hugo Hugo definitely provides great starting point to build high quality websites, but it does require some level of knowledge and experience on some areas. Unlike all-in-one platforms like Wix, Squarespace or Wordpress, you would need to have prerequisite knowledges or experience on the following topics:\nBasic html/css/javascript If you are to use the given themes as they are, this may not be a big of an issue since Hugo provide easy configuations for basic information to customize. However, if you would like to do more than that, you may want to learn html/css/javascript basics to directly edit layout html files, editing css styling or add javascript codes on your own. w3schools.com is a great resource you can start from.\n Web design principles Any design related work comes to the topic of understanding human behavior and their needs. Having understanding on user experience design, visual design and web design principles would be great addition to all other technical skills listed here. I, as a UX specialist, would like to put special emphasis on this topic if you really want to get serious on designing and implementing great user experience. Since many of us are using our mobile phones day in day out, considering mobile layout when designing website would be very important factor should not be missed, for example. 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design is a great read, and you can learn a lot from NN/g group for UX design in general.\n Web hosting If you are using platforms like Wix, Squarespace or Wordpress, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about this at all since all source codes will be hosted on their own server by default. Which also means you barely have controls on your source codes directly in many cases. If you would like to manage your code on your own, or, don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay extra dollars on those platforms subscription fees(usually will cost you from around $100 to several hundreds dollars a year based on the plan you choose), you may want to learn how to host your source code on services like Github or Netlify as mentioned earlier. Github started in 2008 and widely used by many tech companies\u0026rsquo; engineering team for their version control and source code sharing platform. Netlify started in 2014, gaining trackion in the market with their differntiated services like providing private repo even with their free account unlike Github. Both are useful tools to learn to host and publish your websites, mostly free.\n Code editors Since you have to deal with \u0026lsquo;some\u0026rsquo; level of coding experience, you would need to pick one code editor of your preference. I have tried Atom editor, Sublime text editor, Brackets and Visual Studio code editor, and settled down to Vsual Studio code editor for ease of use, lots of plugin supports, built in terminal support, etc. It may require some trial and error to find a code editor best suited for you.\n Markdown Hugo uses Markdown to write contents for sites. Markdown, according to Wikipedia, is defined as \u0026quot;a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.\u0026ldquo; Beauty of using Markdown instead of html is in its simplicity. You only have to remember several key Markdown syntax to write up your blog post without worrying about styling then Hugo will generate great-looking html files along with built in css for you. All you need to do is to keep writing your content using Markdown. This blog post is also written using Markdown.\n Setting up custom domain This is optional and very easy. If you are not interested in getting unique domain name for yourself or your business, you could use default domain name provided by Github for example. But if you are to use your own domain name(i.e, website address name), then you would need to pick your domain name(must be available one), buy it(from one of the domain name providers like Godaddy) and connect your domain name to your web hosting server.\n Command line in terminal You would also need to get familiarize yourself on command line environment in terminal to install and run required programs to run Hugo.\n Conclusion All in all, Hugo is a great tool to allow you build your own websites in short amount of time, once you get over the learning curves listed above. I recently switched from Wix to Hugo for my personal design portfolio site. At first, I started out of pure curiosity how Hugo could work and now I moved my portfolio site completely to Hugo. This saved me $200+ a year, which I really don\u0026rsquo;t needed to pay considering the features I was using from Wix(I paid it mostly because I wanted to peel off Wix ad banner attached to all sites with free plan). Wix is a great all-in-one platform, I am still using it for my freelancing works to build websites for my clients. It has lots of features to support business like cusomter management, creating online stores, setting up online appoinment scheduler, variety of built in widgets, establishing online payment system, and so much more. However, in my case, I only needed fraction of those features and Hugo served it perfectly with no cost(costed mostly my time). If you are looking for simple and affordable web solution like me, Hugo is definitely worth trying.\n","permalink":"https://greatminds.life/blog/post-3/","tags":["Hugo","Web","HTML","CSS","Design"],"title":"Building websites with Hugo"},{"categories":["Finance"],"contents":"Rule of 72 Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to learn about rule of 72, which allows you to estimate how long it will take to double your investment by dividing 72 with the interest rate from your investment vehicle. Following table demonstrates how it works:\n   interest rate Years to double your money     5% 72/5 = 14.4 years   10% 72/10 = 7.2 years   15% 72/15 = 4.8 years   \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;    For example, if you invest $1,000 with the interest of 5%, it will take around 14 years to make it $2,000. This rule assumes compound interest rather than simple interest. Simple interest paradigm doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any time factor considered.\n Formula for calculating compound interest = P (1+i)n - P\nwhere\nP : Principal\ni : Nominal annual interest rate\nn : number of compounding periods\nfor simple interest = P•i\n Reality check How does this rule work in reality? Following chart shows past 10 years of performance of S\u0026amp;P500 ETF product - VOO(VANGUARD S\u0026amp;P 500 ETF). It shows that if you invested $10,000 in the ETF 10 years ago, it would be now $27,511. In this case, the principal amount almost tripled, based on the rule of 72, average annual interest of this product is over 10%. If we choose proper investment vehicle, we could garner full effect of power of time as illustrated in rule of 72. error\nsource: etrade performance report of VOO\nScenarios of monthly savings In real situation, we most likely could save some amount of extra money monthly basis not as lump sum as in the previous example. Following table shows different scenarios with varying amount of monthly savings under the assumption of 10 year investment period with 10% average annual interest rate, how much it will end up after 10 years of investment.\n   monthly saving amount principal amount after 10 years interest earned total     $100 $12,000 $8,655 $20,655   $500 $60,000 $43,276 $103,276   $1,000 $120,000 $86,552 $206,552   $2,000 $240,000 $173,104 $413,104   $5,000 $600,000 $432,760 $1,032,760    Actual numbers in the table may vary according to different calculation methods for compound interest, but this will give good idea around how money will grow with the power of time. Considering the fact that there are so many good investment vehicles out there, with proper research, start saving smallest amount from today makes the most sense to fully leverage the power of time in our investment.\n","permalink":"https://greatminds.life/blog/post-2/","tags":["Finance","Compound effect","Rule of 72"],"title":"Reason to start inversting now, not in the future"},{"categories":["Finance"],"contents":"Colleges are insanely expensive in US Preparing funds to pay college tuition to send kids to colleges is a serious topic in US since cost of attendance is very expensive. You can grasp the idea how much it will cost from the table below. These numbers are based on 2020-2021 academic year which means you would need x4 times of fund to completely cover 4 years of education. This is only for undergraduate schools. On the average, it may require at least $30K a year up to $75K a year. If you have pile of cash to cover this, good for you. If not, question comes up, how to prepare that?\n   Private Public out of state Public in state     $75K+ average $60K+ average $30K+ average   Rice $69,557 UT Austin $58,986 UT Austin $28,756   SMU $79,126 Texas A\u0026amp;M $58,550 Texas A\u0026amp;M $30,024   U Penn $76,826 UC Berkeley $69,304 UC Berkeley $40,692   Standford $78,218 UC Davis $65,780 UC Davis $36,026   Princeton $75,210 U of Michigan $66,698 U of Michigan $$31,056   NYU $78,744 UIUC $55,698 UIUC $37,908    Common misunderstandings  my kids are too young, it\u0026rsquo;s too early to save\nConsidering inflation over time, it will cost more when younger kids go to college. our income is too high, there is no way we can get financial aid\nIncome levels are all relative, and what if one parent loses job when applying? our income is too log, we never have to pay\nNo guarantee to get good financial aid. public schools are much cheaper, forget about private\nIf well planned, you may pay the same amount.  So the take-away here is that it is better to start preparing sooner, regardless of your income level.\nTypes of financial aid There are two types of financial aid provided, merit-based and need-based. Here, we will be focusing on need-based aid.\n   merit-based need-based     based on student achievements based on the data in: FAFSA(Free Application for Federal Student Aid) CSS profile(College Scholarship Service Financial Aid Profile)    2.6B in free college money went unclaimed by 2018 grads From an article by nerdwallet, Anna Helhoski, Oct 16 2018, $2.6B from federal support not claimed by grads just because they didn\u0026rsquo;t apply for it. In the article, 661,000 who are eligible for aid didn\u0026rsquo;t put their application in. It is important to make sure to apply for it regarless of your financial condition.\nActual financial aid given by Princeton University Following images are from Princeton University\u0026rsquo;s home page, demonstrating how they provide financial aids to students. In an ideal situation, parent\u0026rsquo;s out of pocket responsibility could go down to $13K a year, dramatic difference between original cost of attendance.\nsource: https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid\nFollowing table shows the odds of getting granted based on the level of gross family income with average grant given. It says, if you are in $140K-160K salary range, you could get $52,210 financial aid with 100% chance.\nsource: https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid/how-princetons-aid-program-works\nPrivate vs pubic comparison Following image compares private and public school\u0026rsquo;s EFC case. Items are not 1:1, still demonstrates that private could cost as much as public schools in terms of out of pocket cost, not cost of attendance.\nHow \u0026lsquo;NEEDS\u0026rsquo; are calculated? For need-based grant, NEED is calculated as in the following equation.\n NEED = COA - EFC\nwhere\nCOA : Cost Of Attendance - determined by school\nEFC : Expected Family Contribution - money from my pocket\n Apparently, when your needs become big, you will get higher chance of getting grant with more amount. Then question is how to maximize the needs? As you can see from the equation, we can only have control over EFC since COA is fixed value. If we minimize our EFC, our NEEDS will be maximized given COA.\nEFC is determined by the following four factors:\n parent income parent asset student income student asset  If interested in getting more acurate numbers to your situation, this link will show expected aid grant amount based on financial information provided. Following two simplified scenarios are to compare how EFC is affecting the amount of grant using cost-aid calculator from Princeton Unviversity. Assuming all other factors are equal, asset plays huge role in the amount of aid granted. So plan should be geared around the above 4 factors contributing EFC - how to minimize them.\n    Scenario 1 Scenario 2     Gross income 200K 200K   Asset 500K 70K   401K contribution 38K 38K   Total estimated student budget 74K 74K   Total estimated aid 4K 42K    How to lower EFC? This is about to minimize the 4 factors contributing EFC - parent income, parent asset, student income and student asset.\nminimizing parent income As an employee, there is not much room to lower parent income since it is all reported and tracked. One way to get around is to start or get involved in a business apart from day time job so that you can file expenses from the business which will lower your income level.\nminimizing parent asset Asset types which will be included in calculating EFC are as follows:\n 529\nUGMA/UTMA\nStock/Mutual fund/ETF\nSavings/CD\nRental property\nTrust fund\nResident home (public schools may exclude)\n Assets excluded from EFC:\n Qualified retirement fund : 401k, IRA, Roth,\u0026hellip;\nQualified annuity\nIGIP(7702) : IUL(Indexed Universal Life insurance), \u0026hellip;\n Based on this, plan should be focusing reallocating assets from includable to excludable.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re paying mortgage, re-financing would lower the equity value of the house thus decrease EFC.\n529, student expense fund, would require special attention cause some school would immediately disqualify the aid application if you were already putting money in 529. Life insurance products, such as IUL(Indexed Universal Life Insurance), could be used to lower includable assets. You could also get tax benefits as well.\nminimizing student income If student has taxable income, like working as part timer at McDonalds, it will also be included in EFC, not a great idea considering the aid amount could have been granted otherwise.\nminimizing student asset Having savings or brokerage account under kids name, especially with good amount of money in them, would be included as student asset. Also, if you have house(s) under your kids name, that will be included as well so not recommended.\nUseful resources https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\nhttps://www.collegeboard.org/\nhttps://finaid.org/\nhttps://www.irs.gov/\nhttps://withfrank.org/\n","permalink":"https://greatminds.life/blog/post-1/","tags":["Finance","College","Tuition"],"title":"Private schools may cost the same as public schools if well planned"}]
