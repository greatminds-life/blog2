[{"categories":["Finance"],"contents":"Colleges are insanely expensive in US Preparing funds to pay college tuition to send kids to colleges is a serious topic in US. As a parent with two 8th graders(they will be in college if all works out, in the year of 2024), I felt obligated to do something to prepare properly though I don\u0026rsquo;t have any prior knowledge or experience on finance or investment with not so much of disposable cash at hand. I had vague understanding that cost of college would be very expensive, if it comes to private schools, it goes way higher. My unsderstanding on that was not too far away from reality if you look at the following table.\n   School type Average cost per year     Private $75K+   Public out of state $60K+   Public in state $30K+    Out of simple calculation, I should be able to pay (at least) $140K a year for my two kids (if they both go to private schools), easily sums up to $480K for four years. If they choose in state public schools instead, it goes down to $240K, still a lot of money to save. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t have that amount of money in my account, don\u0026rsquo;t think I can save that much in next 2-3 years either. Then my concenrn has deepended, how could I support my kids if they got admission from schools?\nThere is good news though Despite all those stressful figures above, there is good news at least. Most schools provide financial aid if you\u0026rsquo;re qualified, and chance of getting it will go higher if you plan well. You may get more aid for private schools since they are much more expensive than public schools. Take a look at the following image provided by Princeton University. It says average of around $57K is granted to students admitted to class of 2023. Very promising. But is it for every students? Any conditions?\nsource: https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid\nFound another information from the same page as in the following image. This indicates that studenst pay only $13K per year if they are granted full aid as depicted above which is less than half of cost of in state public schools.\nThen question is, will everyone get the aid if they apply? No. There are rules, but odds are very high even if your income level is relatively high according to the following stats also provided by Princeton University. It says you would get the aid around $42K even your annual income is between 180K and 200K with 93% of chance, which is around $36K expected value. Still good amount.\nsource: https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid/how-princetons-aid-program-works\nWhat are the rules to get qualified for aid? To answer this question, need to understand the factors to pass grant process. Grants are basically decided NEED based, which factors in family\u0026rsquo;s financial conditions while MERIT based aids are by students achievements. NEED is calculated from the following equation:\nNEED = COA - EFC where COA : Cost Of Attendance - fixed, posed by school EFC : Expected Family Contribution - money from my pocket As noted, COA is fixed, no way to change it. Plan should be on EFC, how to minimize it to maximize the NEED.\nEFC is defined by the following four factors:\n parent income parent asset student income student asset  If interested in getting more close numbers to your situation, this link will show more accurate expected aid grant amount based on financial information provided. Following two simplified scenarios are to compare how EFC is affecting the amount of grant using cost-aid calculator from Princeton Unviversity. Assuming all other factors are equal, asset plays huge role in the amount of aid granted. So plan should be geared around the above 4 factors contributing EFC - how to minimize them.\n    Scenario 1 Scenario 2     Gross income 200K 200K   Asset 500K 70K   401K contribution 38K 38K   Total estimated student budget 74K 74K   Total estimated aid 4K 42K    Tips to lower EFC to increase chance of getting granted This is about to minimize the 4 factors contributing EFC - parent income, parent asset, student income and student asset.\nminimizing parent income I am an employee of a company so thought there is no room to minimize my income. One way I learned is to get involved in any form of business as a second job so that I can file 1099 tax form. This way, I can include business expenses through the business I am involved to lower my total income. Other than that, parent income is mostly denoted as AGI(Adjusted Gross Income).\nminimizing parent asset Asset types which will be included in calculating EFC are as follows:\n 529 UGMA/UTMA Stock/Mutual fund/ETF Savings/CD Rental property Trust fund Resident home (public schools may exclude)  Assets excluded from EFC:\n Qualified retirement fund : 401k, IRA, Roth,\u0026hellip; Qualified annuity IGIP(7702) : IUL(Indexed Universal Life insurance), \u0026hellip;  Based on this, plan should be focusing moving assets from includable to excludable. If payting mortgage, re-financing would lower the equity value thus decrease EFC.
