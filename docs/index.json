Following table demonstrates it:\n   interest rate Years to double your money     5% 72/5 = 14.4 years   10% 72/10 = 7.2 years   15% 72/15 = 4.8 years   \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;    For example, if you invest $1,000 with the interest of 5%, it will take around 14 years to make it $2,000. This rule assumes compound interest rather than simple interest. Clearly, simple interest paradigm doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any time factor considered.\n Formula for calculating compound interest = P (1+_i_)_n_ - _P_\nwhere\nP : Principal\ni : Nominal annual interest rate\nn : number of compounding periods\nfor simple interest = Pâ€¢i\n Reality check How does this rule work in reality? Following chart shows past 10 years of performance of one of top S\u0026amp;P500 ETF product - VOO(VANGUARD S\u0026amp;P 500 ETF). It tells if you invested in the ETF 10 years ago, it would be now $27,511. In this case, the principal amount almost tripled, we can tell based on the rule of 72, average annual interest of this product is over 10%. Take-away from here is that, if we choose proper investment vehicle, we could garner full effect of power of time as illustrated in rule of 72. source: https://www.etrade.wallst.com/v1/stocks/fund_performance/performance.asp?symbol=VOO\nScenarios of monthly savings In real situation, we most likely could save some amount of extra money in investment. Following table shows different scenarios with different amount of monthly saving under the assumption of 10 year investment period with 10% average annual interest rate.\n   monthly saving amount principal amount after 10 years interest earned total     $100 $12,000 $8,655 $20,655   $500 $60,000 $43,276 $103,276   $1,000 $120,000 $86,552 $206,552   $2,000 $240,000 $173,104 $413,104   $5,000 $600,000 $432,760 $1,032,760    Actual numbers in the table may vary according to different calculation methods for compound interest, but this will give good idea around how money will grow with the power of time. Considering the fact that there are so many good investment vehicles out there, with proper research, start saving smallest amount from today makes the most sense to fully leverage the power of time in our investment.\n","permalink":"https://greatminds.life/blog/post-2/","tags":["Finance","Compound effect","Rule of 72"],"title":"Reason to start inversting now, not in the future"},{"categories":["Finance"],"contents":"Colleges are insanely expensive in US Preparing funds to pay college tuition to send kids to colleges is a serious topic in US since cost of attendance is very expensive. You can grasp the idea how much it will cost from the table below. These numbers are based on 2020-2021 academic year which means you would need x4 times of fund to completely cover 4 years of education. This is only for undergraduate schools. On the average, it may require at least $30K a year up to $75K a year. If you have pile of cash to cover this, good for you. If not, question comes up, how to prepare that?\n   Private Public out of state Public in state     $75K+ average $60K+ average $30K+ average   Rice $69,557 UT Austin $58,986 UT Austin $28,756   SMU $79,126 Texas A\u0026amp;M $58,550 Texas A\u0026amp;M $30,024   U Penn $76,826 UC Berkeley $69,304 UC Berkeley $40,692   Standford $78,218 UC Davis $65,780 UC Davis $36,026   Princeton $75,210 U of Michigan $66,698 U of Michigan $$31,056   NYU $78,744 UIUC $55,698 UIUC $37,908    Common misunderstandings  my kids are too young, it\u0026rsquo;s too early to save\nConsidering inflation over time, it will cost more when younger kids go to college. our income is too high, there is no way we can get financial aid\nIncome levels are all relative, and what if one parent loses job when applying? our income is too log, we never have to pay\nNo guarantee to get good financial aid. public schools are much cheaper, forget about private\nIf well planned, you may pay the same amount.  So the take-away here is that it is better to start preparing sooner, regardless of your income level.\nTypes of financial aid There are two types of financial aid provided, merit-based and need-based. Here, we will be focusing on need-based aid.\n   merit-based need-based     based on student achievements based on the data in: FAFSA(Free Application for Federal Student Aid) CSS profile(College Scholarship Service Financial Aid Profile)    2.6B in free college money went unclaimed by 2018 grads From an article by nerdwallet, Anna Helhoski, Oct 16 2018, $2.6B from federal support not claimed by grads just because they didn\u0026rsquo;t apply for it. In the article, 661,000 who are eligible for aid didn\u0026rsquo;t put their application in. It is important to make sure to apply for it regarless of your financial condition.\nActual financial aid given by Princeton University Following images are from Princeton University\u0026rsquo;s home page, demonstrating how they provide financial aids to students. In an ideal situation, parent\u0026rsquo;s out of pocket responsibility could go down to $13K a year, dramatic difference between original cost of attendance.\nsource: https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid\nFollowing table shows the odds of getting granted based on the level of gross family income with average grant given. It says, if you are in $140K-160K salary range, you could get $52,210 financial aid with 100% chance.\nsource: https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid/how-princetons-aid-program-works\nPrivate vs pubic comparison Following image compares private and public school\u0026rsquo;s EFC case. Items are not 1:1, still demonstrates that private could cost as much as public schools in terms of out of pocket cost, not cost of attendance.\nHow \u0026lsquo;NEEDS\u0026rsquo; are calculated? For need-based grant, NEED is calculated as in the following equation.\n NEED = COA - EFC\nwhere\nCOA : Cost Of Attendance - determined by school\nEFC : Expected Family Contribution - money from my pocket\n Apparently, when your needs become big, you will get higher chance of getting grant with more amount. Then question is how to maximize the needs? As you can see from the equation, we can only have control over EFC since COA is fixed value. If we minimize our EFC, our NEEDS will be maximized given COA.\nEFC is determined by the following four factors:\n parent income parent asset student income student asset  If interested in getting more acurate numbers to your situation, this link will show expected aid grant amount based on financial information provided. Following two simplified scenarios are to compare how EFC is affecting the amount of grant using cost-aid calculator from Princeton Unviversity. Assuming all other factors are equal, asset plays huge role in the amount of aid granted. So plan should be geared around the above 4 factors contributing EFC - how to minimize them.\n    Scenario 1 Scenario 2     Gross income 200K 200K   Asset 500K 70K   401K contribution 38K 38K   Total estimated student budget 74K 74K   Total estimated aid 4K 42K    How to lower EFC? This is about to minimize the 4 factors contributing EFC - parent income, parent asset, student income and student asset.\nminimizing parent income As an employee, there is not much room to lower parent income since it is all reported and tracked. One way to get around is to start or get involved in a business apart from day time job so that you can file expenses from the business which will lower your income level.\nminimizing parent asset Asset types which will be included in calculating EFC are as follows:\n 529\nUGMA/UTMA\nStock/Mutual fund/ETF\nSavings/CD\nRental property\nTrust fund\nResident home (public schools may exclude)\n Assets excluded from EFC:\n Qualified retirement fund : 401k, IRA, Roth,\u0026hellip;\nQualified annuity\nIGIP(7702) : IUL(Indexed Universal Life insurance), \u0026hellip;\n Based on this, plan should be focusing reallocating assets from includable to excludable.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re paying mortgage, re-financing would lower the equity value of the house thus decrease EFC.\n529, student expense fund, would require special attention cause some school would immediately disqualify the aid application if you were already putting money in 529. Life insurance products, such as IUL(Indexed Universal Life Insurance), could be used to lower includable assets. You could also get tax benefits as well.\nminimizing student income If student has taxable income, like working as part timer at McDonalds, it will also be included in EFC, not a great idea considering the aid amount could have been granted otherwise.\nminimizing student asset Having savings or brokerage account under kids name, especially with good amount of money in them, would be included as student asset. Also, if you have house(s) under your kids name, that will be included as well so not recommended.\nUseful resources https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\nhttps://www.collegeboard.org/\nhttps://finaid.org/\nhttps://www.irs.gov/\nhttps://withfrank.org/\n","permalink":"https://greatminds.life/blog/post-1/","tags":["Finance","College","Tuition"],"title":"Private schools may cost the same as public schools if well planned"}]
