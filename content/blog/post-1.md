#### Colleges are insanely expensive in US
<mark>Preparing funds to pay college tuition to send kids to colleges is a serious topic in US since cost of attendance is very expensive.</mark>  You can grasp the idea how much it will cost from the table below.  These numbers are based on 2020-2021 academic year which means you would need x4 times of fund to completely cover 4 years of education. This is only for undergraduate schools. On the average, it may require at least $30K a year up to $75K a year. If you have pile of cash to cover this, good for you. If not, question comes up, how to prepare that?

|Private|Public out of state|Public in state|
| --- | --- |---:|
|<Text style ="color:red;">**$75K+**</Text> average |<Text style ="color:red;">**$60K+**</Text> average | <Text style ="color:red;">**$30K+**</Text> average|
|Rice $69,557|UT Austin $58,986 |UT Austin $28,756|
|SMU $79,126|Texas A&M $58,550| Texas A&M $30,024 |
|U Penn $76,826|UC Berkeley $69,304| UC Berkeley $40,692 |
|Standford $78,218|UC Davis $65,780|UC Davis $36,026|
|Princeton $75,210|U of Michigan $66,698| U of Michigan $$31,056|
|NYU $78,744| UIUC $55,698|UIUC $37,908|

#### Common misunderstandings
1. **my kids are too young, it's too early to save**  
Considering inflation over time, it will cost more when younger kids go to college.
1. **our income is too high, there is no way we can get financial aid**  
Income levels are all relative, and what if one parent loses job when applying?
1. **our income is too log, we never have to pay**  
No guarantee to get good financial aid.
1. **public schools are much cheaper, forget about private**  
If well planned, you may pay the same amount.

So the take-away here is that <mark>it is better to start preparing sooner, regardless of your income level.</mark>

<br>

#### Types of financial aid
There are two types of financial aid provided, merit-based and need-based. <mark>Here, we will be focusing on need-based aid.</mark>

|merit-based| need-based|
|---|---|
|based on student achievements|based on the data in: <br><br> **FAFSA**(Free Application for Federal Student Aid) <br><br> **CSS profile**(College Scholarship Service Financial Aid Profile)|

#### 2.6B in free college money went unclaimed by 2018 grads
From an article by [nerdwallet, Anna Helhoski, Oct 16 2018](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/2018-fafsa-pell-grant/), $2.6B from federal support not claimed by grads just because they didn't apply for it. In the article, 661,000 who are eligible for aid didn't put their application in. <mark>It is important to make sure to apply for it regarless of your financial condition.</mark>

#### Actual financial aid given by Princeton University
Following images are from Princeton University's home page, demonstrating how they provide financial aids to students. In an ideal situation, parent's out of pocket responsibility could go down to **$13K** a year, dramatic difference between original cost of attendance.

Following table shows the odds of getting granted based on the level of gross family income with average grant given. It says, <mark>if you are in $140K-160K salary range, you could get $52,210 financial aid with 100% chance.</mark>

#### Private vs pubic comparison
Following image compares private and public school's EFC case. Items are not 1:1, still demonstrates that <mark>private could cost as much as public schools</mark> in terms of out of pocket cost, not cost of attendance.

#### How 'NEEDS' are calculated?
For need-based grant, **NEED** is calculated as in the following equation.


>**NEED** = **COA** - **EFC**  
>where  
>**COA** : Cost Of Attendance - determined by school  
>**EFC** : Expected Family Contribution - money from my pocket


Apparently, when your needs become big, you will get higher chance of getting grant with more amount.  Then question is how to maximize the needs? As you can see from the equation, we can only have control over **EFC** since **COA** is fixed value.  <mark>If we minimize our **EFC**, our **NEEDS** will be maximized given **COA**.</mark>

EFC is determined by the following four factors:
1. parent income
1. parent asset
1. student income
1. student asset  

If interested in getting more acurate numbers to your situation, this [link](https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid/financial-aid-estimator) will show expected aid grant amount based on financial information provided.  Following two simplified scenarios are to compare how EFC is affecting the amount of grant using cost-aid calculator from Princeton Unviversity.  Assuming all other factors are equal, **asset** plays huge role in the amount of aid granted.  So plan should be geared around the above 4 factors contributing EFC - how to minimize them.

| |Scenario 1|Scenario 2|
|---|---|---|
|Gross income|200K|200K|
|Asset|500K|70K|
|401K contribution|38K|38K|
|Total estimated student budget|74K|74K|
|**Total estimated aid**|**4K**|**42K**|

#### How to lower EFC?
This is about to minimize the 4 factors contributing EFC - parent income, parent asset, student income and student asset.
###### minimizing parent income
As an employee, there is not much room to lower parent income since it is all reported and tracked. <mark>One way to get around is to start or get involved in a business apart from day time job so that you can file expenses from the business which will lower your income level.</mark>
###### minimizing parent asset
Asset types which will be included in calculating EFC are as follows:
> 529  
> UGMA/UTMA  
> Stock/Mutual fund/ETF  
> Savings/CD  
> Rental property  
> Trust fund  
> Resident home (public schools may exclude)

Assets excluded from EFC:
> Qualified retirement fund : 401k, IRA, Roth,...  
> Qualified annuity  
> IGIP(7702) : IUL(Indexed Universal Life insurance), ...

Based on this, plan should be focusing reallocating assets from includable to excludable.  
<mark>If you're paying mortgage, re-financing would lower the equity value of the house thus decrease EFC.</mark>  
<mark>529, student expense fund, would require special attention cause some school would immediately disqualify the aid application if you were already putting money in 529.</mark>
<mark>Life insurance products, such as IUL(Indexed Universal Life Insurance), could be used to lower includable assets. You could also get tax benefits as well.</mark>
 
###### minimizing student income
<mark>If student has taxable income, like working as part timer at McDonalds, it will also be included in EFC, not a great idea considering the aid amount could have been granted otherwise.</mark>

###### minimizing student asset
<mark>Having savings or brokerage account under kids name, especially with good amount of money in them, would be included as student asset.</mark>
<mark>Also, if you have house(s) under your kids name, that will be included as well so not recommended.</mark>
