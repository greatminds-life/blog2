#### Rule of 72
Recently, I've got to learn about <mark>rule of 72</mark>, which allows you to estimate how long it will take to doulbe your investment by dividing 72 with the interest rate from your investment vehicle. Following table demonstrates it:

|interest rate|Years to double your money|
|---|---|
|5%|72/5 = 14.4 years|
|10%|72/10 = 7.2 years|
|15%|72/15 =  4.8 years|
|...|...|

For example, if you invest $1,000 with the interest of 5%, it will take around 14 years to make it $2,000. This rule assumes **compound interest** rather than **simple interest**. Clearly, **simple interest** paradigm doesn't have any time factor considered.

> **Formula for calculating compound interest** **=** _P_ (1+i)<sup>n</sup> - P  
> where  
> P : Principal  
> i : Nominal annual interest rate  
> n : number of compounding periods
>
><br>
>
> **for simple interest =**  _P_â€¢_i_

<br>

#### Reality check
How does this rule work in reality? Following chart shows past 10 years of performance of S&P500 ETF product - <mark>VOO(VANGUARD S&P 500 ETF)</mark>. It tells if you invested $10,000 in the ETF 10 years ago, it would be now $27,511. In this case, the principal amount almost tripled, we can tell based on the rule of 72, average annual interest of this product is over 10%. Take-away from here is that, <mark>if we choose proper investment vehicle, we could garner full effect of power of time as illustrated in rule of 72.</mark>

#### Scenarios of monthly savings
In real situation, we most likely could save some amount of extra money in investment. Following table shows different scenarios with varying amount of monthly savings under the assumption of 10 year investment period with 10% average annual interest rate.

|monthly saving amount|principal amount after 10 years|interest earned|total|
| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:|
|$100|$12,000|$8,655|$20,655|
|$500|$60,000|$43,276|$103,276|
|$1,000|$120,000|$86,552|$206,552|
|$2,000|$240,000|$173,104|$413,104|
|$5,000|$600,000|$432,760|$1,032,760|

Actual numbers in the table may vary according to different calculation methods for compound interest, but this will give good idea around how money will grow with the power of time.  Considering the fact that there are so many good investment vehicles out there, with proper research, start saving smallest amount from today makes the most sense to fully leverage the power of time in our investment.
